keys: A X C S E R H

5 orderings that result in the best case tree.

H C S A E R X
H S C A E R X
H C S A E X R
H C S A R E X
H C S A R X E

basically, optimal tree looks like:

          H
       C     S
      A E   R X

You just have to make sure that you insert each level in order, so:

(1) H
(2) C S in any order
(3) A E R X in any order

an algorithmic way to find best tree is to take the median of the sequence,
and set that as the root.  Then the left node is the sequence on the left of the
ordered sequence, and the vice versa for the right node.
