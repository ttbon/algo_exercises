b. 4, 10, 8, 7, 53

is not possible when searching for 5.  For this to be a credible sequence,
any new value must be greater than the max of values less than 5 presented
thus far, and also less than the min of values greater than 5 presented thus far.

So a sneakier, impossible sequence would be

4, 10, 2, 5

Because 2 is less than 4, it should be on the sub-tree left of 4
