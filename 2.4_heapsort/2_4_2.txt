Keeping the maximum works for updating and returning the maximum in constant
time, but only if you are trying to keep only the maximum of the entire stream
and will never pop the value.  In essence this is a TopM priority queue with
M=1.  The issue is that it then would become very expensive if you pop your
current max and need to find the next largest value.
