Ordered array is the worst, because insert operations are expensive.

You could use a d-ary heap sort with a high d-value, which decreases the cost
of swim operations from inserts.

Unordered array also works because insert is constant time, but find the max is
linear time.

Heap-sort versus unordered array will depend on the relative frequency.
