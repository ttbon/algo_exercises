Yes, it is legal.  Every legal input can be hashed, it is easy to compute,
and it evenly distributes the values, but over the range of just the one
number, 17.

The fact that all inputs map to the same number make defeat the purpose of
having a hash function though.  When used for a hash table this will lead
to sequential search, which yields very poor performance.
